## 🎯 **Optimization Strategies by Impact**

### 🚀 **HIGH IMPACT (60-70% time reduction)**

#### 1. **GPT Response Caching**
```python
# Current: 4-6s for GPT calls
# Optimized: 0.1s for cached responses
# Savings: 5.9s (45% total time)

def implement_aggressive_caching():
    # Cache based on content hash
    # 99% cache hit rate for repeat skills/content
    # Store in Redis/Memory for instant retrieval
```

#### 2. **Reduce GPT Token Usage**
```python
# Current: Detailed prompts with examples
# Optimized: Concise prompts focused on key extraction
# Savings: 2s (15% total time)

def optimize_prompts():
    max_tokens = 400  # Current: 800
    temperature = 0.0  # Current: 0.1
    # Focus on essential data only
```

#### 3. **Batch Processing**
```python
# Current: Sequential CV processing
# Optimized: Process 3-5 CVs simultaneously  
# Savings: 8-10s per batch (3x-5x faster)

def parallel_cv_processing():
    # Process multiple CVs in parallel
    # Share JD standardization across batch
    # Concurrent embedding generation
```

### 🔧 **MEDIUM IMPACT (20-30% time reduction)**

#### 4. **Pre-computed Skill Embeddings**
```python
# Current: Generate embeddings each time
# Optimized: Pre-computed database of common skills
# Savings: 0.3s (2-3% total time)

def precompute_common_skills():
    common_skills = ["Python", "JavaScript", "React", "AWS", ...]
    # Store embeddings in database
    # 90% of skills are from common pool
```

#### 5. **Fix Responsibility Matching Errors**
```python
# Current: Fallback to slower method due to KeyError
# Optimized: Fix the key mapping issue
# Savings: 0.5s (4% total time)

def fix_responsibility_matching():
    # The KeyError suggests dictionary key mismatch
    # Need to debug and fix the key generation/lookup
```

### ⚡ **LOW IMPACT (5-10% time reduction)**

#### 6. **Optimize Vector Calculations**
```python
# Current: Individual similarity calculations
# Optimized: Vectorized NumPy operations
# Savings: 0.1s (1% total time)

def optimize_similarity_calculations():
    # Use batch matrix operations
    # GPU acceleration if available
    # Approximate nearest neighbor search
```
