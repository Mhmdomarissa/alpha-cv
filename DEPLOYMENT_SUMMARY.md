# 🚀 Production Deployment Summary

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Completed

---

## 📋 Overview

Successfully deployed the latest code changes to production with zero data loss, while resolving critical disk space issues and optimizing storage infrastructure.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Disk Space Crisis Resolution**
- **Problem:** Root filesystem was 100% full (193G used, 3.9MB available)
- **Root Cause:** Docker data consuming 86GB on root filesystem
- **Solution:** 
  - Discovered unmounted 209GB additional storage (`/dev/nvme1n1`)
  - Moved all Docker data (86GB) to `/mnt/additional-storage`
  - Created symlink from `/var/lib/docker` to `/mnt/additional-storage/docker`
  - Result: Root filesystem now 8% used (15G/193G), 178GB available

### 2. **Production Data Backup**
- **PostgreSQL:** 46MB backed up to `/mnt/additional-storage/backups/production_20251008_095638/`
- **Qdrant:** 373MB backed up to `/mnt/additional-storage/backups/production_20251008_095638/`
- **Total Backup Size:** 419MB

### 3. **Code Deployment**
- **Fixed numpy recursion error:** Downgraded from numpy 1.26.4 to 1.26.2
- **Deployed features:**
  - ✅ Fixed years of experience display (handles float values, prioritizes LLM extraction)
  - ✅ Dynamic experience warning messages
  - ✅ Admin job filter dropdown (All Jobs / Your Jobs / Others' Jobs)
  - ✅ Filter-aware empty states on careers page

### 4. **Service Status**
All production services running successfully:
- ✅ Backend (FastAPI) - healthy on port 8000
- ✅ Frontend (Next.js) - running on port 3000
- ✅ Nginx - serving on port 80
- ✅ PostgreSQL - healthy on port 5433
- ✅ Qdrant - running on ports 6333/6334
- ✅ Redis - running on port 6379
- ✅ Prometheus - monitoring on port 9090
- ✅ Redis Exporter - metrics on port 9121

### 5. **Data Integrity Verification**
- ✅ All Qdrant collections intact (7 collections)
- ✅ Backend health check passing
- ✅ Frontend serving correctly
- ✅ No data loss during migration

### 6. **Monitoring Setup**
- Created `/home/ubuntu/monitor-disk-usage.sh` script
- Configured cron job to run every 6 hours
- Thresholds:
  - Warning: 80% usage
  - Critical: 90% usage
- Logs to: `/home/ubuntu/disk-usage-monitor.log`

## 🔑 Key Changes

### Backend
- `alpha-backend/requirements.txt`: numpy 1.26.4 → 1.26.2
- `alpha-backend/app/services/matching_service.py`: Fixed `safe_parse_years` to handle float
- `alpha-backend/app/routes/special_routes.py`: Fixed `safe_parse_years` to handle float
- `alpha-backend/app/utils/qdrant_utils.py`: Prioritize `years_of_experience` over `experience_years`
- `alpha-backend/app/services/careers_service.py`: Recalculate warning with LLM-extracted years

### Frontend
- `cv-analyzer-frontend/src/components/careers/ProfessionalJobPage.tsx`: Fix field name mismatch
- `cv-analyzer-frontend/src/components/careers/CareersPage.tsx`: Add admin filter dropdown

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Changes

### Storage Architecture
```
Before:
/var/lib/docker (86GB) → /dev/root (193GB total, 100% full) ❌

After:
/var/lib/docker → /mnt/additional-storage/docker (206GB total) ✅
/dev/root: 8% used (178GB available) ✅
```

### Backup Location
- Old: `/home/ubuntu/backups` (on root filesystem)
- New: `/mnt/additional-storage/backups` (on additional storage)

---

## 📝 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Automated Monitoring
- **Script:** `/home/ubuntu/monitor-disk-usage.sh`
- **Schedule:** Every 6 hours (via cron)
- **Log File:** `/home/ubuntu/disk-usage-monitor.log`

### Manual Checks
```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h

# Check Docker status
docker-compose ps

# Check backend health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# View monitoring logs
tail -f /home/ubuntu/disk-usage-monitor.log

# Run manual disk check
/home/ubuntu/monitor-disk-usage.sh
```

## ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **Monitor additional storage:** Currently at 97% - consider cleanup or expansion
2. **Regular backups:** Automated backup script should be implemented
3. **Log rotation:** Set up log rotation for application and monitoring logs
4. **Cleanup strategy:** Implement automated cleanup of old Docker images/volumes

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Improvements)

1. Set up automated database backups with rotation
2. Implement log rotation for all services
3. Add disk space cleanup automation
4. Set up alerting (email/Slack) for critical disk usage
5. Consider expanding additional storage if usage continues to grow

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Service won't start**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs [service-name]
```

**Q: Disk space issues**
```bash
# Check usage
df -h

# Clean Docker
docker system prune -a

# Check monitoring logs
tail /home/ubuntu/disk-usage-monitor.log
```

**Q: Need to rollback**
```bash
# Restore from backup
cd /mnt/additional-storage/backups/production_20251008_095638/
# Follow restore procedures
```
