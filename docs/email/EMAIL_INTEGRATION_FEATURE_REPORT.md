# 📧 **Email-to-CV Processing Feature - Implementation Report**

## **Feature Name:** Automated Email CV Processing with Azure Integration

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Implementation Duration:** 1 Session  

---

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**

We have successfully implemented an **Automated Email-to-CV Processing System** that integrates Microsoft Azure Graph API with your existing CV processing pipeline. This feature enables automatic processing of job applications received via email, eliminating manual CV uploads and streamlining the recruitment workflow.

---
## 🚀 **What We Built**

### **1. Azure Email Integration Service**
**File:** `alpha-backend/app/services/azure_email_service.py`

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Connects to Microsoft Graph API using Azure App Registration
- ✅ Monitors mailbox (`cv@alphadatarecruitment.ae`) for new emails
- ✅ Filters unread emails with CV attachments
- ✅ Parses email subjects to extract job information (e.g., "Software Engineer | SE-2025-001")
- ✅ Downloads CV attachments (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT)
- ✅ Extracts email body content
- ✅ **Intelligent salary extraction** from email body (supports multiple formats: AED 5000, 5k, ranges, etc.)
- ✅ Matches emails to job postings using unique subject IDs
- ✅ Tracks processed emails to prevent duplicates

**Key Improvements:**
- Robust salary extraction with 7+ pattern matching algorithms
- HTML email body parsing and cleaning
- Efficient email filtering (removed problematic orderby clause)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **2. Email CV Processor**
**File:** `alpha-backend/app/services/email_cv_processor.py`

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Seamlessly integrates with existing CV processing pipeline
- ✅ Saves CV attachments to S3 storage
- ✅ Processes CVs through LLM standardization
- ✅ Generates embeddings using shared model
- ✅ Stores CVs in Qdrant database
- ✅ Creates job applications with full metadata
- ✅ **Manual matching workflow** - CVs are stored without automatic matching for HR review
- ✅ Extracts expected salary from email body automatically
- ✅ Sends confirmation emails to applicants

**Key Design Decision:**
- **No automatic CV-JD matching** - HR maintains full control over matching process
- CVs are flagged with `requires_manual_matching: true` for HR workflow
- All CV data is preserved for manual review and matching

### **3. Email Processing API**
**File:** `alpha-backend/app/routes/email_routes.py`

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/email/process-emails` - Manual email processing trigger
- `POST /api/email/process-emails/background` - Background processing
- `GET /api/email/health` - Azure connection health check
- `GET /api/email/status` - Processing statistics and monitoring
- `POST /api/email/webhook/email-received` - Real-time webhook support
- `POST /api/email/admin/reset-processed-emails` - Admin control (reset processed list)
- `GET /api/email/admin/processed-emails-count` - Admin monitoring

**Security:**
- ✅ JWT authentication on all endpoints
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin-only endpoints)
- ✅ Integrated with existing security middleware

### **4. Email Scheduler**
**File:** `alpha-backend/app/services/email_scheduler.py`

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Automatic email checking every 5 minutes (configurable)
- ✅ Background processing without blocking main application
- ✅ Processing statistics tracking
- ✅ Daily statistics reset
- ✅ Force processing on demand
- ✅ **Single-instance scheduler** with file locking (prevents duplicate processing across multiple workers)

**Key Improvement:**
- File-based locking mechanism ensures only ONE scheduler runs across all Uvicorn workers
- Prevents race conditions and duplicate email processing

## 🔄 **Complete Workflow**

### **From Naukri to Database:**

```
1. HR Posts Job on Naukri
   ↓
2. HR Creates Job in Career Page
   → System generates unique subject ID: "Software Engineer | SE-2025-001"
   ↓
3. HR Forwards Naukri Job to cv@alphadatarecruitment.ae
   ↓
4. HR Sends Emails to Applicants
   → Uses subject template from career page
   ↓
5. Applicants Reply with CV Attachments
   → Emails arrive at cv@alphadatarecruitment.ae
   → Email may contain salary expectations in body
   ↓
6. System Processes Automatically (Every 5 Minutes)
   → Azure Email Service reads emails
   → Parses subject to find matching job posting
   → Extracts CV attachments
   → Extracts salary expectations from email body
   ↓
7. CV Processing Pipeline
   → Document parsing (PDF, DOCX, OCR)
   → LLM standardization
   → Embedding generation (shared model)
   → S3 storage upload
   ↓
8. Database Storage
   → CV stored in Qdrant (cv_documents, cv_structured, cv_embeddings)
   → Application linked to job posting
   → Flagged for manual HR matching
   → Salary expectation stored
   ↓
9. HR Review & Action
   → HR views applications in careers page
   → HR performs manual CV-JD matching
   → HR reviews salary expectations
   → HR makes hiring decisions
```
